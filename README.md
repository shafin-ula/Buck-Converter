# Buck-Converter

Designed and built a high-efficiency PWM-controlled buck converter using MOSFET switching and inductive filtering. Assembled and soldered a PCB built from KiCAD and performed hardware debugging using an oscilloscope, function generator, and multimeter. Verified voltage regulation and switching behavior across varying duty cycles, frequencies, and load conditions. Achieved 90+% power efficiencies frm testing.
